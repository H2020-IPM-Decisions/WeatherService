# Represents an amalgamation type for a parameter. This is used in the amalgamation property of
# the weather data standard. The id is in binary, so it's bitmapped
# This means that if several tests fails for a parameter, each test can be specified.
# E.g. If a parameter has been both interpolated (value=2) and replaced (value=2), the 
# value will be 3 (1 + 2)
